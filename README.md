## Abstract: 
The main goal of this model is to identify factors that play a role in hairfall and uses Random Forest to predict whether an individual will experience hair fall based on these factors. This model provides a cohesive and personalizable solution in determining if someone is likely to face hair loss. Furthermore, this can facilitate early detection, timely identification, and improve healthcare guidance for effective treatment planning. 

## Set Up Instructions
I recommend creating an environment to run this code. Here are the instructions for that: 
**Step 1:** Open the terminal and go to the directory that contains the Jupyter notebook and requirements.txt from this page. <br>
**Step 2:** Now, moving on to creating an environment. For Windows type "python -m venv env" and, for Mac/Linux type "python3 -m venv env" <br>
- The env is the environment name and can be changed to whatever you'd like to name the environment. <br>

**Step 3:** Activate the environment. For Windows, type "env/Scripts/activate.bat" (if that does not work try removing the ".bat"). For Mac/Linux, type "source env/bin/activate" <br>
- It is important to note that the "env" in both Windows and Mac/Linux commands is the name of the environment. <br>

**Step 4:** Install the requirements. Type "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal. <br>
**Step 5:** Once done running the notebook, you can deactivate the code by typing "deactivate" in the terminal. <br>
